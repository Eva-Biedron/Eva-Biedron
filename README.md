Eva Biedron is a data-driven paleontologist who is fascinated by the relationships between animals, their environment, and their life histories. She has studied how marsupial dental stable isotopes and microwear patterns track habitat and diet (MS, Vanderbilt University, 2018) and the diversity of Miocene squirrel communities in hypothesized mixed-woodland environments (BS, University of Oregon, 2016). With nearly a decade of work in archives and paleontological collections and research, including multiple collection-based NSF-funded projects, Eva places great importance on improving her skillset; she has earned a graduate certificate in project management (Harvard University, 2021) and can code in R, python, and SQL. Her collections-based interests include specimen data best-practices and database management, outreach, and understanding the management and impact of large historic collections in modern research.
